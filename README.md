# 🚀 Space Invader Game (OOP Semester 2 Project)

A terminal-based **Space Invader** style shooting game developed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in **C++**. This project was created as part of the FAST NUCES Spring 2025 curriculum for the Object-Oriented Programming course.

---

## 📊 Overview

The game replicates the classic Space Invaders experience using Modern gui with raylib. It features:

* Multiple enemy types and levels
* Player-controlled spaceship
* Bullet shooting and collision detection
* Score tracking and life system
* Basic file handling for saving scores
* Well-structured code using classes and inheritance

---

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

* Applying OOP principles: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism and Abstraction
* Managing game loops and logic in Gui applications
* File handling and data persistence
* Structuring a multi-class C++ project

---

## 🔧 Features

* 🌌 **Multiple Levels** with increasing difficulty
* 💪 **Player Ship** with movement and shooting
* 🚗 **Enemy Movement**: vertical & horizontal
* 🔫 **Bullet Physics** and Collision Detection
* 📊 **Score Display** Maintains top 10 Scores Throughout the life span of game using filing
* 💔 **Life System** and Game Over condition
* 📃 **File Saving**: high scores
* Background music and sound effects
